FromParam
=========

This plugin is a tiny addition to ActiveRecord::Base that establishes a better 
convention for finding records based on parameters. It adds a "from_param" class
method to ActiveRecord::Base as a convention for fetching a model from a URL
parameter. By default it will find a record based on the to_i of the passed in
parameter, but the real use is by overriding it.

It's time to move away from generated-key-dependence, and this plugin is an attempt
to make that easy, painless, and work easily within the existing systems.

Example
=======

  # default behavior

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  
  end
  
  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    # GET /users/1
    def show
      @user = User.from_param(params[:id]) # => <User id=1 login=mbleigh>
    end
  end
  
  # overriding
  
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    def to_param
      login
    end
    
    def self.from_param(parameter)
      User.find_by_login(parameter)
    end
  end
  
  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    # GET /users/mbleigh
    @user = User.from_param(params[:id]) # => <User id=1 login=mbleigh>
  end
